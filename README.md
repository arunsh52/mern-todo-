# MERN Todo

This project is a robust and user-friendly To-Do List application built using React, enriched with essential user authentication features. It combines the power of modern web development with a seamless user experience. 
To install packages for a React project with user authentication, you typically use npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn (another package manager). Here's a step-by-step guide on how to install packages for your project:

* Open Your Terminal: Open your command-line terminal or integrated terminal in your code editor. Make sure you are in the root directory of your React project.

* Initialize a New React Project (If Not Already Done): If you haven't already created a React project, you can do so using Create React App (CRA). Run the following command to create a new project:

``` 
npx create-react-app my-todo-app
```
Replace my-todo-app with your desired project name.

* Navigate to Your Project Directory: Change your working directory to your project's root folder:

* Navigate to Your Project Directory: Change your working directory to your project's root folder:
```
cd my-todo-app
```
Replace my-todo-app with your actual project folder name.

* Install Packages: To install the necessary packages for user authentication and other dependencies, you'll need to use either npm or yarn. Below are the commands for both package managers:
    * Using npm:
    ```
    npm install axios react-router-dom react-bootstrap firebase
    ```

* Configuration: After installing these packages, you may need to configure them according to your project's requirements. For instance, if you're using Firebase for user authentication, you'll need to set up Firebase with your project by following Firebase's setup instructions.
```
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
```

* Import and Use the Packages: In your React components, you can import and use the installed packages as needed. For example, if you're using React Router for routing, you would import it like this:

* Start Your Development Server: Finally, start your development server to see your changes:
```
npm start
```
This process will install the necessary packages for your React project, and you can begin building your To-Do List application with user authentication using these packages. Remember to refer to the documentation of each package for specific usage instructions and configurations.
